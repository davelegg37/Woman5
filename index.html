		<div>Start Game
</div>
		<div>A Woman's Life GameWalk in a Woman’s Shoes by playing the Woman’s Life game. In this game you will have to negotiate life in the role of a woman.
You must travel 4 roads that a typical woman must travel in the course of living a woman’s life, the sexual road, the hidden road, the road of violence and a road of SociaL Subjugation. On each road  you will encounter 3 roadblocks The Male roadblock, the Societal  road block, the Physical roadblock. To get to the end of each road you must overcome the roadblocks. To win the game you must get to the end of all four roads.
You begin the game with 4 resources; money, power, status, and your life. You also have 4 weapons you can use to deal with the  roadblocks; Subservience ,Silent Rebellion, Open Rebellion, Physical Resistance.
You use a Weapon to try and overcome a roadblock but use of the the weapon will cost you resources and some are more effective the others. Usually the more effective the weapon the more expensive it is in terms of resources. For instance standing up to a physically threatening male my cost you your life and thus end the game while subservience will preserve your life but result in your being raped and huge drop in your self esteem. You begin the game with a score of150 points but as you use up resources your score drops. The goal of the game is to travel all three roads with the highest score. The game ends if your score reaches 0 or you Die. You also have a (#MeTo) button that allows you to escape the game by reporting to yourself or another a personal experience.

At each roadblock you encounter a real world problem faced by a woman reflective of the roadblock and the road you are traveling. For instance at the male roadblock on the sexual path you might encounter inappropriate and unwanted groping by a male. You can react  by choosing subservience as your weapon (just letting it go and trying to escape) which might let you get past the roadblock but with great cost in your resources (life  and status-self esteem ). You might choose silent rebellion by telling your friends etc what happened so others will avoid the same trap. This  might work to stop this particular male as word gets around but increase aggression towards you  as males band together to retaliate against you. You could choose open rebellion by reporting the incident to authorities which legally removes this particular male but at a cost to you and your privacy as the whole incident becomes public. Finally you could choose violent resistance which removes the immediate roadblock but at risk of escalation to damaging physical abuse and possible loss of life thus ending the game.
